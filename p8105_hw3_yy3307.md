# Problem 1

The first step we need to do is importing the `instacart` data from
`p8105.datasets`.

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
```

*The `Instacart` dataset contains data of online grovery services which
allow peopleto shop online from local stores. The dataset has 1384617
rows and 15 columns, which includes variables of
`order_id, product_id, add_to_cart_order, reordered, user_id, eval_set, order_number, order_dow, order_hour_of_day, days_since_prior_order, product_name, aisle_id, department_id, aisle, department`.
We can make some data analysis with this dataset, for instance, we can
indicate which type of grocery is most popular by counting frequencies
of `aisle` variable. Also, we can observe something like the
`reorder rate`, the `reorder rate` of this dataset is 0.5985944, which
means that about 59.86% of all customers would like to reorder.*

We can use `count` and `distinct` functions to find the total number of
aisles. And we also need to return the `name` of aisle which most
repeated being ordered, `which.max` can help us find that aisle.

``` r
num_aisle = count(distinct(instacart, aisle))

aisle_most = names(which.max(table(instacart$aisle)))

except_fresh =
  instacart %>%
  filter(!grepl('fresh vegetables', aisle))
aisle_2most = names(which.max(table(except_fresh$aisle)))
```

*There are **134** distinct aisles, **fresh vegetables** and **fresh
fruits** are the most items ordered from.*
